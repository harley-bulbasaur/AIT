## Agenda

* inheritance + prototypes
* net module, nc, curl browser <---------- important
* class activity
    * 5 questions on previous material
    * 1 create a question + an answer
        * review quiz (does not count towards grade)
        * maybe include as pool for random 1 or 2 questions on exam

## Inheritance and Prototypes

* Basic reviewing:

```javascript
class Werewolf{
    constructor(n){
        //this = {}
        this.n = n;
        //return this
    }
    howl(thing){
        console.log(this.n, "howls at the", thing)
    }
}

const w = new Werewolf('wally')
w.howl('in class activity')

Object.hasOwn(w, 'n');//true
Object.hasOwn(w, 'howl');//false, howl is defined on the prototype of w
// What's the prototype of w?
Object.getPrototypeOf(w) === Werewolf.prototype //Note that Werewolf is not same as Werewolf.prototype
Object.getPrototypeOf(Werewolf.prototype) === Object.prototype // true (Werewolf is just an object)
Object.getPrototypeOf(Werewolf) === Function.prototype // true, typeof Werewolf is function
```

* Remember to use `new` to call a constructor

```javascript
class Foo {
    
}
const f = new Foo(); 
console.log(f)
// Prints an instance: Foo {}
```

If you are not using new, the constructor will change the variable of global object in <u>sloppy mode</u>. 

It'll gives you an error in <u>strict mode</u>.

### Extension

* We can also extend a class

    ```javascript
    class PartyWerewolf extends Werewolf {
        
    }
    const p = new PartyWerewolf('wendy');
    p.howl('beverages');
    Object.getPrototypeOf(p) === PartyWerewolf.prototype
    Object.getPrototypeOf(PartyWerewolf.prototype) === Werewolf.prototype
    ```

* If you use old version of oop in js:

    ``` javascript
    function Werewolf(n){
        this.n = n;
    }
    Werewolf.prototype.howl = function() {}
    
    function PartyWerewolf(n, backwordsCap=true){
        //this = {}
        //kind of like super?
        //only handles own properties from parent class constructor
        Werewolf.call(this, n)
    }
    
    // copies methods over
    // Originally, PartyWerewolf.prototype ={}
    PartyWerewolf.prototype = Object.create(Werewolf.prototype)
    
    //don't do either of these!!!
    PartyWerewolf.prototype = new Werewolf(''); // copies over superfluous properties
    PartyWerewolf.prototype = Werewolf.prototype; // We can't change parent or sub class without changing the other
    ```

    

## Net Module

* net module - creation of tcp/ip clients and servers
    * allows you to create server that can handle connections. react when data is sent
* We'll build 
    * web server
    * web framework (server side)


### web server

* 几种不同的server  (00:30:00)

1. request static files from server

    - Apache

    - nginx
    - server in 90s

2. database driven server side web app
    * Most logic are in server

3. single page web apps

    *  Server first gives back an html framework, then you need data from api
    * gmail is like this

    

* What We do:

1. create server side framework

    * mimics - express <------- we are doing this
    
    * koa

    * next.js (also handles some frontend fw w/ react)
    
        
    
    * Http request method
    
        * GET <-----
        * POST <----
        * PUT
        * DELETE
    
    ```javascript
    import net from 'net';
    
    // pass in callback function that is called when client connects
    const server = net.createServer(function(){
        console.log('client connected');
    })
    
    server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1')
    ```
    
    * The `server.listen` keeps the server running
    
    * We can use `nc`to make a connection to the server
    
        * `ncat localhost 3000`
        * The program will print client connected
    
    * The callback function can actually take an argument
    
        * use `sock` for socket in convention
        * use `sock.on()` to set an event handler on the event on the first argument
            * Here, the first event is `'data'` - receiving data
        * use `sock.write()` to send back data to the socket
        * use `sock.end() `to stop the connection, otherwise it's still hanging
    
        ``` javascript
        const server = net.createServer(function(sock){
            console.log('cloent connected');
            sock.write('Hello world!');
            // on will set event handler for evet spec'd in first arg
            sock.on('data', function(data){
                console.log(data+'');//convert to str
            })
            sock.end();
            
        })
        ```
    
    > How to coerce your browser to make a request 
    >
    > * Put in a url
    > * Click on a link
    > * Form
    > * Access a page with images and css

#### HTTP response

* If you try to use a browser to connect to your server, it'll give you Error: Invalid http
    * You need to formulate a proper http response
    * Format: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type:text/html\r\n\r\n<h1>Title</h1>`
    * `200` is the status code
    * `\r\n` separates each line in the http response
    * `Content-type` is response header

```javascript
const server = net.createServer(function(sock){
    console.log('cloent connected');
    sock.write('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type:text/html\r\n\r\n<h1>Title</h1>');
    // on will set event handler for evet spec'd in first arg
    sock.on('data', function(data){
        console.log(data+'');//convert to str
    })
    sock.end(); 
})
```

* <u>Status Codes</u>
    * 1xx - Informational
    * 2xx - OK
    * 3xx - Redirects (temporary, permanent, see other)
    * 4xx - Client Error
        * If you make the same request, you are getting the same responses
        * 401 - Authorization Request
        * 403 - Forbidden
        * 404 - Not Found
    * 5xx - Server Error
        * Same request may give you different responses

> What would happen if we try to connect localhost:3000/foo?
> It still works!
>
> Ideally, we should get a 404

## quiz

```javascript
function assignment(n){
    console.log(this.name+' has '+n+' assignments.')
}
const course = {
    name: 'AIT',
    assignment
}

//If we want to print 'AIT has 10 assignments.'
//what of the following is correct?
course.assignment(10) //
assignment(10)
assignment.call(course,10) //
assignment.call(course)
assignment.apply(course,10)
assignment.apply(course,[10]) //
const f = assignment.bind(course); f(); //
```
